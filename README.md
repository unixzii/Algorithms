# Common Algorithms

[![Travis](https://travis-ci.org/unixzii/Algorithms.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/unixzii/Algorithms)

This project contains a group of common algorithms implemented in Java and each provides a complete unit test.

By far, it's just at a very beginning state and more algorithms will be added in continuously. Currently finished ones are listed below:

### Sorting
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort
* Heapsort

### Graph
* Graph Data Structure
* DFS
* BFS

### N-Queens
* Classic Recursive Algorithm
* Bitwise Algorithm

### Path Finding
* A*

### Dynamic Programming
* Longest Common Subsequence
